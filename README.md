### Project of my web development course at trybe (MySQL)

---

# About this project

> This is my third and final MySQL project in the course. In it, I gather all the knowledge I've learned so far, creating a dump and some queries to manipulate this database.
> I was given an excel sheet with some information so I can throw it into a new database. For that, I gathered the information that made sense to be in the same table, I used 1NF, 2NF and 3NF to better organize the data and, finally, I created a dump by hand (I could have used the creation via the graphical interface of MySQL WorkBench , but I preferred to train the correct use of constraints).
> After that, I just manipulated this same database created, through several queries (using joins, groupers, views, triggers, stored functions and stored procedure).
